Execute all tasks automatically from tasks.md in proper dependency order.

This is the sixth step in the Spec-Driven Development lifecycle - automated implementation of all planned tasks.

Given any implementation context provided as an argument, do this:

**If you have access to subagents** (like Task tool in Claude Code):
1. Generate agent prompt(s) using `scaffold-agent`:
   - Single agent: `specifyx run scaffold-agent implementer:feature-implementation --json`
   - Multiple agents: `specifyx run scaffold-agent implementer:feature-impl code-reviewer:quality-check test-reviewer:coverage --json`
2. Launch the subagent(s) with the generated prompt(s) to handle systematic task execution following TDD principles
3. When dispatching multiple agents in parallel, consider creating shared context first:
   - Create context: `specifyx run scaffold-agent context:shared-implementation-context --json`
   - Reference the context file path when launching multiple agents to ensure they work with consistent information

**If you do NOT have access to subagents**:
1. Navigate to your spec directory (e.g., `specs/001-feature-name/`) and examine the files:
   - `tasks.md` - Contains your implementation tasks
   - `plan.md` - Shows implementation phases and progress
   - `spec.md` - Contains the feature specification

2. Review the current implementation status by examining:
   - Task completion status in `tasks.md` (marked with `- [x]` for completed)
   - Phase progress in `plan.md` (checkboxes for completed phases)
   - Current branch and feature directory from your git status

3. Execute tasks systematically following these phases:

   **Phase 1: Validation & Prerequisites**
   - Verify constitution exists (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`)
   - Validate spec, plan, and tasks files are complete
   - Check project structure and dependencies
   - Ensure all task dependencies form a valid DAG (no circular dependencies)

   **Phase 2: TDD Enforcement (MANDATORY)**
   - Write and execute all test tasks BEFORE their corresponding implementation tasks
   - Tasks marked with [TEST] must pass before implementation can proceed
   - Failed tests must be resolved before continuing

   **Phase 3: Task Execution**
   - Execute tasks in dependency order
   - Tasks marked with [P] can be done in parallel when dependencies allow
   - Mark completed tasks as [x] in tasks.md as you finish them
   - Track progress and document any blockers

4. Handle errors and failures:
   - **Critical failures**: Halt and document the issue in tasks.md
   - **Test failures**: Stop related implementation tasks until tests pass
   - **Dependency failures**: Mark dependent tasks as blocked

5. Track implementation progress:
   - Update task status in tasks.md: `- [ ]` → `- [x]` as you complete each task
   - Document any deviations from the plan
   - Log significant decisions and their rationale

6. Final validation:
   - Run full test suite to verify implementation integrity
   - Validate that all acceptance criteria from spec.md are met
   - Check that no tasks remain in pending state
   - Update documentation as needed

**Next Steps After Implementation:**
- Review implementation against acceptance criteria
- Run final test suite and quality checks
- Update documentation if needed
- Prepare for deployment or next feature iteration

**Important Notes:**
- The `/implement` command enforces TDD by design - all tests must be written and pass before implementation tasks can execute
- Use `/guide` command if you prefer detailed manual step-by-step instructions
- If you have subagent support, leverage `scaffold-agent` to generate specialized agent prompts for complex tasks
